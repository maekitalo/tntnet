/** Main application class for stand-alone tntnet web application

    The Tntnet class is used to compile a web application into a simple executable.
    The compiled program then works as a webserver, handling the server requests
    for the web application.
    This is the alternative to compiling it into a shared library and using the
    tntnet program to handle the server requests.

    This is the minimal set of things you have to include in your code to create a
    standalone tntnet web application:
    @li The instantiation of a Tntnet object
    @li A call to listen
    @li One or more calls to mapUrl or vMapUrl
    @li A call to run()

    Example:
    @code
      #include <iostream>
      #include <tnt/tntnet.h>

      int main()
      {
        try
        {
          tnt::Tntnet app;

          app.listen(8000);

          app.mapUrl("^/$", "index");
          app.mapUrl("^/(.*)$", "$1");
          app.mapUrl("^/.*$", "404");

          app.run();
        }
        catch(const std::exception& e)
        {
          std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
          return 1;
        }

        return 0;
