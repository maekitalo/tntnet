gd demo Tntnet application
==========================

This application demonstrates the use of dynamically generated images in tntnet.

The dynamically generated images uses the famous GD Graphics Library from
Boutell.Com. To make it more C++ style, we created a small C++ wrapper around
that.

The application has 2 main parts: the html screen `gd.ecpp`, which displays a
form and the generated image and the actual image creation component
`imgstr.ecpp`. The image creation component expects a query parameter `str` and
generates a image with that text drawn into a small image. For output the png
format is used.

Building and running
--------------------

To build the application you need to install tntnet and gd. For common linux
distributions you need the development package of gd, which contains the
headers and link libraries. The package is named gd-devel in fedora at least.

Running `make` build the application and running `tntnet` starts the server.
You can access the application using a browser using the url
http://localhost:8000/ or the hostname of the server if you want to access the
application remotely.
